\df_ghosts_SelfMissilesOnly [ DEFAULT: 1 RANGE: 0 (off), 1 (on) ] - when a ghost is recording, ghost will only record missiles from the player who is being recorded.  When this is off, the ghost will record ALL missiles that are being fired, regardless of owner.  Turning this option to off can be useful mainly for doing democams for non-self missiles.  Note that for creating ghosts from demos, for mods OTHER THAN DEFRAG, you should set this cvar to 0.
