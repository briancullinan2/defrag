\df_ob_OffsetStopPosZ [ DEFAULT: 0.00 RANGE: -F TO F ]

Allows the player's ending (landing position) to be offsetted.  This can be used to find new OB heights, such as determining if landing on another player will cause a new OB height.

Example: df_ob_OffsetStopPosZ 128.000 (would be the same as landing on top of a stack of 2 players)

*** NOTE:  You can monitor this cvar by assigning 79 (CH_INFO_OVERBOUNCE_VOFFSETS) to one of the crosshair stats info slots.
