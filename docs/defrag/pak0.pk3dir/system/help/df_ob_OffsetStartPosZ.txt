\df_ob_OffsetStartPosZ [ DEFAULT: 0.00 RANGE: -F TO F ]

Allows the player's starting (current standing position) to be offsetted.  This can be used to find new OB heights, such as determining if standing on another player will cause a new OB on another platform.

Example: df_ob_OffsetStartPosZ 64.000 (would be the same as standing on top of another player)

*** NOTE:  You can monitor this cvar by assigning 79 (CH_INFO_OVERBOUNCE_VOFFSETS) to one of the crosshair stats info slots.
